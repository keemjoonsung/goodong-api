## goodong : Graduation Project - SKKU 2024

3D model repository web - combine with Blender Add-on (https://github.com/kjs990114/goodong-blender-addon)<br>
AI-based Export & Import 3D model<br>
AI-based Tagging & search

  
  <br>

## Project Objective

GitHub plays a significant role as a popular platform for software developers to
store, manage, share code, or showcase their portfolios. However, in the field of
3D modeling, there currently isn't a similarly popular platform now. By
establishing a repository for 3D models, designers can effectively manage their
work and use it as a portfolio to showcase their creations. It is expected to
provide innovative platforms for professionals in the 3D modeling field, thereby
fostering advancement within the industry.
